// Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring.
// If there are more than one with the maximum length, return any one.

// For example, the longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb". 
// The longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".

//is the whole thing a palindrom?
//does taking one of the end make it a palindrome?
//does taking one off the front make it a palidrome?b
